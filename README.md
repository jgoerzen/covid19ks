# COVID-19 in Kansas: Masks vs. No-Masks

In 2020, some counties in Kansas adopted a mask requirement while others didn't.  The Kansas Department of Health and Environment published a [chart](kdhe-chart.pdf) illustrating COVID-19 changes in masks vs. without counties.

Some people questioned whether this chart was misleading due to its use of different Y-axis.  This repository produces a similar chart with a unified Y-axis and shows that the result was not misleading.  Here is the chart I generated:

The source data is us-counties.csv from the [covid-19-data set](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data), collected by the New York Times based on government sources.  The [Johns Hopkins CSSE data set](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) is also used to plot alternative versions of these charts.

I have [many more graphs](images/README.md) also available.

# Invocation

To run, you must pass it the path to the NYT `us-counties.csv` file and the John Hopkins `csse_covid_19_daily_reports` directory.  For instance:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
git clone https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
git clone https://github.com/jgoerzen/covid19ks
cd covid19ks
cargo run --release -- ../covid-19-data/us-counties.csv ../COVID-19/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports
```

With these commands, you can verify these results for yourself.  If you don't already have Rust installed, see the [Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) page.
